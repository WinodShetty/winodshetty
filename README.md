## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a DevOps and AWS Cloud Engineer with **4+ years of experience** — 3 years focused on cloud and DevOps, and a year in frontend development. I’ve worked across the stack, building secure and scalable infrastructure on AWS, automating workflows with Terraform and Ansible, and setting up CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and Git.

I’m also comfortable with containers (**Docker, Kubernetes, EKS**), monitoring tools (**Prometheus, Grafana, ELK**), and bringing security into the pipeline (**SAST, DAST, image scanning**). Earlier in my career, I spent time working with frontend tools like **React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript** — which gave me a solid understanding of user-facing development too.

I enjoy solving problems, automating things that slow teams down, and working closely with developers, designers, and other engineers.

**CI/CD** has been a key part of my workflow — I’ve built and maintained efficient pipelines to speed up development, testing, and deployment while reducing manual work.

### 🚀 Future Goals

I'm currently expanding my knowledge into backend, frontend, and even design. I’m also exploring other cloud platforms like **Azure** and **GCP** to broaden my cloud expertise. While I’m still learning, my goal is to eventually work confidently across the full tech stack. I believe strong teamwork and continuous learning are essential to building great products.
